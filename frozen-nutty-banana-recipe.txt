Say banan-yeah to this healthy snack. Cut 1 firm (but ripe) banana in half and unpeel, arrange on a small baking sheet or freezer-safe plate, and spread each half with 1 tablespoon almond butter (on the sides not touching the plate). Here’s the fun part: Stick whatever toppings you like on the almond butter—our favorites are granola, chia or flaxseeds, and cinnamon. Insert a popsicle stick or skewer into the cut end of each half and freeze until solid (at least 2-3 hours).
